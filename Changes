Revision history for Perl extension Sys::Hwloc.

0.05  2010/12/21
      - added Sys::Hwloc::Obj->sprintf() as additional alias for
        hwloc_obj_sprintf() and Sys::Hwloc::Topology->sprintf_obj()

      - added Sys::Hwloc::hwloc_compare_objects with aliases
        Sys::Hwloc::Topology->compare_objects and
        Sys::Hwloc::Obj->is_same_obj
        to compare the raw C pointer values

      - added constant HWLOC_XSAPI_VERSION
        (returns 0 where HWLOC_API_VERSION returns undef)

      - implemented Cpuset and Bitmap API with some basic helpers
        and handy functions that are not part of the hwloc C API

      - destructors $topology->destroy, $cpuset->free, $bitmap->free
        set the unlerlying C pointer to NULL after freeing the
        C struct. This helps to circumvent double-free and
        SIGSEGV. We should implement a DESTROY some day. This
        needs the perl objects to be proxies that store the
        C pointer in some hidden property, instead of being
        simple T_PTROBJ.

      - added PODs for Sys::Hwloc::Topology,
        Sys::Hwloc::Obj, Sys::Hwloc::Cpuset, Sys::Hwloc::Bitmap

      - added the "Artistic License 2.0" to LICENSE

0.04  2010/12/14
      - rewrote from scratch using typemapping
      - added OO-ish methods for hwloc_obj_t and hwloc_topology_t objects
      - support for HWLOC_API_VERSION (undef) .. 0x00010100
      - named the module Sys::Hwloc and submitted to CPAN

0.03  2010/12/07
      - additional constants for hwloc_get_obj_data retrieval
          HWLOC_ObjName       string or undef
          HWLOC_ObjMemory     hashref
          HWLOC_ObjChildren   array
      - rewrote hwloc_get_obj_data with direct stack manipulation
      - made 2nd arg to hwloc_get_obj_data optional,
        if not present, return object data as hashref
      - use perl type UV for unsigned C types

0.02  2010/09/11

          -O -n Hwloc /usr/local/hwloc-1.0.2/include/hwloc.h
